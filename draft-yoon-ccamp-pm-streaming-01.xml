      <t>
        With the rise of AI-driven applications, network digital twins, and increasingly 
        dynamic network environments, there is growing demand for performance management 
        (PM) streaming capabilities. PM streaming enables proactive issue detection, 
        allowing network operators to identify and address potential problems before they 
        affect service. It also helps optimize resource allocation, ensuring efficient use 
        of bandwidth and other network resources.
      </t>
      <t>
        The ITU-T G.7710 standard provides a foundational framework for managing transport 
        network elements, addressing requirements, parameters, and measurement methods for 
        performance management. However, G.7710 does not define YANG data models or 
        specific protocols needed for PM streaming, which are essential for modern network 
        management. To support PM streaming, various IETF documents and protocols 
        (<xref target="RFC9232" format="default"/>, <xref target="RFC8639" format="default"/>, 
        <xref target="RFC8640" format="default"/>, <xref target="RFC8641" format="default"/>) 
        can be utilized. This document provides a YANG data model for PM streaming in 
        network equipment based on ITU-T G.7710, demonstrating how to subscribe to the 
        YANG model using the IETF push model.

        PM streaming is a real-time method for measuring and transmitting data to monitor 
        the performance and health of network devices and systems. It provides valuable 
        insights into key metrics like errored seconds (ES), latency, and packet loss, 
        helping to optimize networks, detect anomalies, and manage faults proactively. 
        Unlike traditional periodic data collection, PM streaming delivers continuous 
        updates, enabling faster, more responsive network adjustments.
      </t>
      <t>
        Using telemetry protocols like YANG Push, PM streaming allows for more frequent 
        and detailed performance monitoring. By integrating this data into AI-driven 
        analytics, it supports preemptive interventions, enhancing overall network 
        reliability. Additionally, it keeps digital twins synchronized with the physical 
        network, offering real-time insights for predictive maintenance, planning, and 
        optimization.
      </t>
      <t>
        The procedures for Performance Management streaming between a network node and 
        clients such as operation systems (OS), AI applications, Network digital twins 
        (NDT) involve continuous measurement of performance metrics on PM parameters using 
        three methods: counts (tracking event occurrences), snapshots (instantaneous 
        metric values), and tidemarks (extreme values over a period). Clients can 
        initiate the process by sending a subscription request specifying the metrics, 
        measurement methods, intervals, and filtering criteria. Once the node confirms 
        the subscription, it collects and aggregates PM data based on the requested 
        metrics and intervals. Notifications with PM data, including timestamps, metrics, 
        and measurement methods, are sent to clients at each interval via protocols like 
        NETCONF or RESTCONF. Clients then process the data, using it for real-time 
        monitoring, historical analysis, or triggering alerts based on thresholds. They 
        can also manage subscriptions by modifying parameters or suspending them as needed.

      <name>Measurement Methods</name>
      <t>
        In network performance monitoring, ITU-T G.7710 defines two measurement methods 
        that measure a metric value with periodic intervals such as 15-minute or 24-hour 
        periods: counter measurements ("counts") and gauge measurements ("snapshots" and 
        "tidemarks"). These complementary methods provide a holistic view of network 
        behavior by capturing both long-term trends and real-time conditions. The counter 
        measurements provide data on the frequency of specific events, enabling long-term 
        analysis of recurring issues. Meanwhile, the gauge measurement involves capturing 
        instantaneous values of performance monitoring metrics at one-second intervals. 
        This high-frequency sampling occurs during defined periodic intervals rather than 
        continuously. They offer real-time insight and capture extreme conditions, helping 
        to identify immediate performance problems or deviations from normal behavior.
      </t>

      <section anchor="sect-4.1" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Counts</name>
        <t>
          Counts measurement in network performance monitoring tracks the cumulative 
          occurrences of specific events over a defined period, such as 15 minutes or 
          24 hours. This method captures how frequently certain network activities, like 
          errors or transmission issues, occur, providing a historical view of recurring 
          problems. Counts reset at the end of each interval, ensuring that every period 
          starts with a fresh count for accurate monitoring. The primary purpose of counts 
          is to identify trends and patterns in network behavior over time, helping 
          operators detect anomalies or areas where issues frequently arise. This type of 
          measurement is particularly useful for long-term analysis, enabling preventive 
          maintenance and optimizing network performance. Unlike instantaneous 
          measurements, counts focus on aggregation over time, making it easier to 
          understand the persistence or recurrence of faults. The data gathered through 
          counts helps in fault management and planning by highlighting repeated errors, 
          congestion, or performance degradation that may affect service delivery. As a 
          result, counts provide network operators with actionable insights for 
          troubleshooting and capacity planning, ensuring smooth operation and reliability 
          across the network.

        <name>Snapshots</name>
        <t>
          Snapshots are instantaneous measurements taken at a specific point in time. They 
          capture the instantaneous value of specific performance parameters at a regular, 
          predefined point (uniform time) within each time interval. Snapshots provide a 
          "momentary view" of network conditions, allowing operators to observe the 
          network's status at specific intervals. The data from these uniform-time 
          snapshots is then aggregated and analyzed to understand the immediate state 
          across the entire network. By taking snapshots simultaneously across all network 
          elements, operators can correlate data between different parts of the transport 
          network. Snapshots are collected at pre-determined uniform times within fixed 
          intervals (e.g., every 15 minutes, 24 hours). The uniform time and fixed 
          intervals can be configured based on the needs of the network.

        <name>Tidemarks</name>
        <t>
          Tidemark measurements record the maximum (high tidemark) and minimum (low 
          tidemark) values that a performance parameter reaches during a specified 
          observation window. These extreme values offer insight into the range of 
          performance fluctuations, highlighting the best and worst conditions that occur 
          within the monitoring period. Tidemark measurements provide deeper insights by 
          capturing performance spikes or drops that may go unnoticed in average or 
          cumulative data, enabling precise troubleshooting of intermittent or extreme 
          conditions. For instance, while the average error rate over a period may appear 
          acceptable, a high tidemark could reveal intermittent spikes in errors that 
          require attention. Conversely, a low tidemark may expose periods of severely 
          degraded signal quality or throughput.

      <t>
        Clients can receive a streaming of values of the PM parameters (PM data) by the
        measurement methods of counts, snapshots, and tidemarks with various time intervals,
        after subscribing to them in equipment. The streaming data measured on the PM
        parameters are used for maintenance and Quality of Service (QoS) monitoring in networks.

        <name>Maintenance and QoS monitoring</name>
        <t>
          Performance management data contribute to enhancing overall network reliability.
          It consists of Maintenance and QoS data generated by maintenance and QoS parameters 
          respectively. These two categories serve different purposes and focus on distinct 
          aspects of network management. By continuously tracking different aspects of network 
          performance, they ensure that the network infrastructure remains robust, capable of 
          meeting operational demands, and able to deliver consistent and high-quality services 
          to users.
        </t>
        <t>
          The Maintenance data is to ensure the overall operational integrity and reliability
          of the network. It is focused on maintaining the health of the physical network
          infrastructure, detecting and diagnosing faults, and addressing any issues that could
          compromise network stability. Maintenance-related performance parameters are typically
          aimed at identifying physical layer issues, equipment malfunctions, or any performance
          degradation. These metrics are particularly useful for preventive and corrective
          maintenance activities. Common maintenance metrics might include error counts, signal
          degradation measurements, and transmission errors. These types of data help in triggering
          alarms or initiating repairs to physical network elements, such as optical fiber problems
          or electrical signal faults.
        </t>
        <t>
          On the other hand, the QoS data is primarily concerned with monitoring and ensuring
          the quality of services delivered over the network. While maintenance focuses on network
          health at the infrastructure level, QoS is centered on the performance of data
          transmission and how effectively the network meets the needs of end-users. QoS data
          is used to measure the quality of services such as voice, video, and other data 
          applications that require stable and reliable network performance. Metrics for QoS 
          often include latency (the delay in data transmission), jitter (the variation in packet 
          arrival times), packet loss, bandwidth utilization, and throughput. These metrics are 
          crucial in ensuring that the network delivers services at a level that meets or exceeds 
          the expectations outlined in service-level agreements (SLAs).
        </t>
        <t>
          Maintenance data typically deal with the health and status of individual network 
          elements or links. They often involve unidirectional measurements to detect faults or 
          issues in specific components or paths. QoS data often need to be measured in both 
          directions of a communication path to ensure overall service quality. This is because 
          many applications and services rely on two-way communication, and the user experience 
          depends on performance in both directions.

        <name>Time intervals</name>
        <t>
          In network performance management, periodic time intervals of 15 minutes and 24
          hours are commonly used for network nodes to measure and notify performance data of
          clients. These intervals serve distinct purposes, helping network operators monitor
          both short-term fluctuations and long-term trends in network performance.
        </t>
        <t>
          The 15-minute interval provides granular, real-time monitoring, allowing network
          operators to quickly detect and address short-term issues such as spikes in latency
          or packet loss. It is particularly useful for ensuring compliance with Service-Level
          Agreements (SLAs) and for managing highly dynamic networks where rapid changes can
          occur. In contrast, the 24-hour interval is used for long-term performance monitoring
          and trend analysis, helping operators understand overall network health, detect
          slow-developing issues, and plan for future capacity needs. This longer interval offers
          a broader view of the network's performance over a full day, making it ideal for
          strategic planning and infrastructure maintenance. Together, these intervals enable
          both immediate responses to network conditions and long-term network optimization.
        </t>
        <t>
          In the context of emerging technologies like AI and network digital twins,
          smaller sampling intervals are becoming increasingly necessary. These technologies
          demand real-time or near-real-time performance data to function optimally. As these
          capabilities become more integral to advanced network operations, the shift towards
          smaller sampling intervals ensures that they can operate efficiently, react to network
          changes faster, and improve overall network reliability and performance.

        <name>PM Parameters</name>
        <t>
          Metric value of PM parameters is measured for maintenance and QoS monitoring 
          over networks. Quality of Service (QoS) parameters are designed to assess 
          the network's long-term ability to consistently deliver agreed-upon service 
          quality to customers. They primarily verify performance against contractual 
          obligations defined in service-level agreements (SLAs) over longer intervals 
          (24 hours, monthly periods). By simultaneously measuring both directions of 
          a bidirectional connection, QoS parameters provide a holistic view of the 
          sustained quality experienced by users, ensuring stability and predictability.
        </t>
        <t>
          Maintenance parameters focus on short-term monitoring and detailed analysis 
          for operational reliability. Maintenance parameters, over intervals such as 
          15 minutes or 24 hours, facilitate swift responses to intermittent faults, 
          bursts of errors, and subtle performance changes. Maintenance parameters typically 
          involve unidirectional analysis, where each direction of transmission is 
          monitored independently. This unidirectional approach helps network operators 
          precisely pinpoint faults, troubleshoot intermittent issues, and perform 
          preventive maintenance effectively.

        Threshold Events are triggered when a metric value reaches or crosses a pre-defined
        threshold. There are two types of threshold event notifications: periodic
        and non-periodic event notifications.

        <t>[Counter measurement events]</t>
        <t>
          Counter measurement ("counts") has two types of threshold reporting methods:
          transient and standing condition methods. The transient condition method
          treats each measurement period separately. As soon as a threshold is reached or crossed 
          in a 15-minute/24-hour period for a given performance measurement, a threshold report (TR) 
          is generated. The standing condition method is an option for 15-minute periods. The standing 
          condition is raised, and a TR (Threshold Report) is generated, when the set threshold is 
          reached or crossed. The standing condition is cleared, and a reset threshold report (RTR) 
          is generated at the end of the period when the current value is below or equal to the reset 
          threshold, provided that there was no unavailable time during that period.

          crosses the high threshold. An underflow condition is determined and an out-of-range report 
          is generated as soon as the gauge value is at or below the low threshold. These out-of-range

        <t>
          The pm-measurements module consists of a periodic measurement container and 
          notification of threshold events. The pm-periodic-measurement container 
          aggregates various measurement types (counts, snapshots, tidemarks) and 
          collects data at regular intervals. It includes mechanisms for continuous 
          count-based tracking, instantaneous snapshot captures, and the recording of 
          peak values over time. This integrated approach enables operators to obtain a 
          complete and detailed view of network performance trends, allowing them to 
          monitor steady behavior, capture transient conditions at specific moments, and 
          identify peak usage or stress periods effectively.
        </t>
        <t>
          Complementing the periodic measurements, the threshold events notification 
          (periodic-threshold-events and non-periodic-threshold-events) incorporates an 
          event detection mechanism that uses threshold criteria to trigger alerts when 
          performance metrics deviate from expected ranges. One aspect focuses on 
          scheduled comparisons where measurements are consistently evaluated against 
          predefined thresholds, while the other captures unexpected or isolated

          not only helps in identifying persistent issues, but also ensures that sudden, 
          anomalous performance events are promptly recognized and addressed.

        <name>Relationship between measurement and parameter modules</name>
        <t>
          The performance measurements module leverages the imported parameters from the 
          PM parameters module, ensuring that all performance-related settings, such as 
          thresholds and timing information, are defined consistently. By doing so, it 
          promotes uniformity across the system, making sure that the data collected 
          adheres to a common structure and can be easily interpreted by different 
          network components.
        </t>
        <t>
          This modular approach not only streamlines the management of measurement 
          parameters but also facilitates interoperability between different network 
          devices and management systems. As a result, any updates or refinements made 
          to the parameter definitions in the PM parameters module automatically benefit 
          the measurements module, reinforcing the overall flexibility and maintainability 
          of the performance management framework.

        Below are practical use cases demonstrating different subscription scenarios. These 
        examples illustrate periodic and non-periodic subscriptions, including notifications 
        triggered by threshold breaches. Each example aligns with IETF YANG Push protocols, 
        showcasing how network elements generate and stream performance data based on subscription 
        parameters.
